# Measuring and profiling mooR

The project states that performance is paramount in the hot crates, and that an
optimisation must be proved rather than asserted. This skill is how you prove
it. It owns the benches, the profilers, the trace facility and the runtime
counters; `moor/working-in-the-repo/conventions` states the
rule and points here, and `moor/working-in-the-repo/build-and-run`
gives the profiles a measurement needs.

The hot crates are `crates/db` and `crates/kernel`, named as such in `AGENTS.md`.
In practice `crates/var` and `crates/vm` are as hot, because they sit under every
instruction the VM runs.

## The measurement ladder

Climb from the top only as far as you must. Each rung costs more time and gives
a broader answer.

| Rung | Tool | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | A bench in `crates/*/benches` | Did this function get faster |
| 2 | A load tool in `crates/testing/load-tools` | Did the whole transaction and scheduling path get faster |
| 3 | The `trace_events` build | Where does wall-clock time go across tasks, transactions and verbs |
| 4 | `perf`, through the scripts in `tools/perf` | Which instructions, cache misses and branch mispredictions cause it |
| 5 | The in-world counter builtins | What is a running server actually doing, right now |

A rung-1 result alone does not justify a change in `db` or `kernel`. Those
crates are reached through a transaction and a scheduler, and a micro-benchmark
that skips both can improve while the system gets slower.

## The benches

All benches use the `micromeasure` harness with the standard test harness turned
off, not Criterion. That choice matters: micromeasure reports hardware
performance-counter data alongside timing, so a bench can tell you instructions
per cycle, front-end stalls and branch prediction, not only nanoseconds.

| Crate | Bench | Measures |
|---|---|---|
| `var` | `var_benches`, `map_benches`, `symbol_benches`, `flyweight_benches` | Value construction and access for each value kind, map operations, symbol interning, flyweights |
| `var` | `var_repr_benches` | Codegen probes for alternate scalar representations. The timings are secondary; the point is the release assembly the loops produce |
| `common` | `verbcasecmp_benches` | The verb-name matching comparison, which runs on every dispatch |
| `compiler` | `compile_benches`, `objdef_benches` | Compilation throughput, and objdef parsing |
| `db` | `tx_relation_benches`, `tx_worldstate_benches` | Transactional relation and world-state operations |
| `db` | `verb_cache_benches`, `prop_cache_benches` | The verb and property lookup caches, under light and heavy contexts |
| `kernel` | `vm_benches` | Interpreter throughput, run to a tick limit, isolated from world-state mutation |
| `kernel` | `vm_micro_benches` | Opcode dispatch at the CPU level: instructions per cycle, stalls, branch prediction |
| `kernel` | `verb_dispatch_bench`, `property_dispatch_bench`, `builtin_dispatch_bench` | The cost of a verb call, a property access and a builtin call through the VM loop, isolated from the scheduler |
| `kernel` | `activation_bench`, `activation_stack_capacity_bench` | Frame and activation construction, and the allocation and drop cost of the activation stack's backing store |
| `schema` | `var_encode_benches` | Encoding a value to the wire and persistence form |

The bench list drifts. Read the `[[bench]]` sections of a crate's `Cargo.toml`
for the current set, and the module comment at the top of each bench for what it
claims to isolate. Those comments are careful; trust them over a guess.

Run a bench with `cargo bench -p <package> --bench <name>`. Benches are compiled
by CI as part of the all-targets build, so a bench that does not compile fails
the build even though nobody ran it.

## Profiling with perf

`tools/perf` holds Linux `perf` wrappers. They exist because the arguments are
tedious and easy to get subtly wrong.

**A running server.** `tools/perf/profile-running-moor.sh` records from a live
`moor` or `moor-daemon` process for a fixed duration and bundles the recording
with the exact executable image the process was running, so symbols still
resolve later. It takes an optional duration and process id, writes the archive
to the current directory unless told otherwise, and checks access to the CPU
performance counters before it starts, reporting which kernel setting to change
if access is blocked.

**Activation and frame construction.** This path is hot enough to have its own
profiling binary, `activation_profile` in the kernel crate, which runs one named
scenario in a loop with no Criterion or micromeasure framing around it.
`tools/perf/activation-profile.sh` builds it in release, runs it, and writes
counter statistics, a recording and two reports under the target directory. The
scenario, iteration count and warm-up are set by environment variable.
`tools/perf/activation-analyze.sh` regenerates reports, including an annotated
disassembly, from a recording you already have. The scenario names and the
default output paths are in `tools/perf/README.md`.

## Tracing across the system

The `trace_events` feature compiles in Chrome Trace Event Format emission. It is
declared in `moor-vm`, `moor-kernel`, `moor-daemon` and `moor-server`, and the
daemon and server flags forward it down. When the feature is off, the emission
points compile to nothing.

What is captured: task lifecycle, including creation by command, verb, eval and
out-of-band, and suspension and resumption; verb calls and builtin execution in
the VM; database transaction begin, check, apply, commit and rollback; and
scheduler queue depth. Events are batched onto a background thread and flushed
periodically, so the recording cost is small but not zero.

Build with the feature and pass a trace output path. The launchers already do
it: the traced bacon job, the traced npm scripts and the tracing compose
override. Load the resulting file into a trace viewer. `doc/TRACING.md` in the
repository holds the current commands and the viewer list.

Use a trace when the question is "where does the time go", not "how fast is this
function". A trace is the right tool for a transaction that keeps retrying, a
task that suspends unexpectedly, or a verb that dominates a command.

## Runtime counters on a live server

The runtime carries always-on metrics through the `fast-telemetry` crate:
counters and sampled timers in the world-state layer, the scheduler, the task
program cache, the builtin dispatch table and the database caches. These cost
nothing to have and are not behind a feature flag.

They are readable from inside the world through wizard-only builtin functions
that return a map of name to count and elapsed nanoseconds, one for builtin
functions, one for database operations and one for the scheduler. Two more
report process memory and database size on disk. The names are registered in the
kernel's server builtins; get the current set from the builtin documentation
rather than from a list here, and see
`moor/execution/builtin-functions`.

The database also exposes statistics for its verb, property and ancestry caches.
A cache hit rate that has dropped is often the whole explanation for a
regression.

Ordinary logging goes through `tracing`, initialised once in `moor-common` and
driven by `RUST_LOG`. This is diagnosis, not measurement: log volume changes
timing.

## What "zero-copy" and "cache-friendly" mean here

These words are used precisely in this project. They describe designs already in
the code, and a change is expected to preserve them.

**In `crates/var`.** A value is a small, cheaply copied representation. Strings
and lists are reference-counted and shared rather than copied on assignment;
persistent immutable collections give a cheap clone with structural sharing.
Symbols are interned so that a name comparison is an integer comparison, not a
string comparison. The scalar representation is deliberately tuned, to the point
that one bench exists only to inspect the assembly it produces. A change that
makes `Var` larger, or that makes a clone deep, is a serious regression even if
no bench notices.

**In `crates/db`.** Reads go through caches for verb lookup, property lookup and
ancestry, because those are the queries the VM makes constantly. Stored bytes
are handled as views over shared buffers rather than being decoded into owned
structures on every read. A change that adds a decode or an allocation to a read
path costs on every property access in the world.

**In `crates/kernel`.** The activation stack is reused rather than reallocated
per call; that is why it has its own bench. Builtin dispatch is an index into a
table, not a lookup by name. Compiled programs are cached per task. A change
that puts an allocation, a hash lookup or a string comparison into verb
dispatch, property access or opcode dispatch is on the hottest path in the
system.

Practically: before you add an allocation, a clone, a `String`, a hash map or a
trait object to any of these paths, measure. After you add it, measure again.

## Rules of measurement

1. **Measure a release build.** A `dev` build is not the program. A profile
   taken on a debug build shows the cost of unoptimised code and misleads you
   about where time goes. The `release` profile keeps full debug information for
   exactly this reason, so use it rather than inventing a custom profile.
2. **Measure both sides on the same machine, in the same session.** A number
   from your machine compared against a number from CI, or from yesterday, is
   not evidence.
3. **Interleave the runs.** Run before, after, before, after. A machine that
   warms up or throttles produces a monotone drift that looks exactly like an
   improvement.
4. **Do not measure with tracing compiled in** unless tracing is what you are
   measuring.
5. **Match the rung to the claim.** A claim about the database or the scheduler
   needs a rung-2 result. A claim about one function may stop at rung 1.
6. **Keep the evidence.** Put the numbers in the pull request.
   `moor/working-in-the-repo/conventions` requires it.

## Failure branches

| Symptom | Cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| The bench result moves as much between runs of the same code as between versions | Machine noise: other load, frequency scaling, a laptop on battery | Quiet the machine, pin frequency if you can, and interleave runs. If the change is smaller than the run-to-run spread, you have not shown anything |
| A micro-benchmark improves but the server does not | The bench skipped the transaction and scheduler path that the real call goes through | Re-measure with a load tool from `crates/testing/load-tools`, or with a traced run. The dispatch benches say in their own comments that they isolate from the scheduler; that isolation is the thing you must undo to confirm |
| A profile shows time in unexpected places, spread thinly | You profiled a debug build | Rebuild with `--release` and profile again. The perf scripts build release for you; a hand-run `perf` may not |
| `perf` refuses to record | The kernel restricts access to performance counters | The script reports which setting to change |
| Symbols do not resolve in a recording | The binary was rebuilt or is in a container | Use `tools/perf/profile-running-moor.sh`, which bundles the exact image with the recording |
| No trace file appears | The binary was built without `trace_events`, the output path was not given, or the directory is not writable | Check all three. `doc/TRACING.md` lists the same three |
| The trace file grows unmanageably | Tracing was left on for a long run | Trace a bounded period. A shorter, focused capture is easier to read as well as smaller |
| A counter builtin returns an error | It is wizard-only | Run it as a wizard. See `moor/execution/permissions-and-security` |
| A regression appears with no code change in the hot path | A cache hit rate fell, or a transaction is retrying | Read the database cache statistics and the transaction counters before you read any code. See `moor/storage-and-state/transactions` |
| A change is faster but the reviewer objects | The gain came at a readability cost with no number behind it | The project accepts a readability cost only with evidence. Produce it, or revert |
