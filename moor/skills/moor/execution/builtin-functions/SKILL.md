# mooR builtin functions

A builtin is a Rust function called from MOO by name. The compiler turns the name
into a numeric id at compile time and stores that id in the program. The VM looks
the id up in a registry of function pointers and calls it.

Read `virtual-machine` first. A builtin runs inside the VM's activation stack and
inside the task's transaction, and both facts constrain what it may do.

## Numbering is frozen

Builtin ids are embedded in compiled programs, and compiled programs are stored in
the database. Reordering or removing a builtin changes ids and invalidates every
stored program.

The id table is `crates/common/src/builtins.rs`. It is divided into fixed-size
groups, one per `bf_*` module, each padded out with reserved entries. Reserved
entries are hidden from name lookup and from `function_info()` but still occupy
their ids. That padding is the whole point: a new builtin appends inside its own
group and no other group moves.

The group ordering is: server/system, connection/network, task/scheduler,
numeric/math, value conversion and introspection, string/binary/encoding,
list/set/regex, map, object/command, object load and dump, verbs, properties,
flyweights, documents/formats, cryptography, algorithms. Group size is a constant
in that file; read it there rather than from here.

Stored programs carry a hash over the ids they use. If the table changes under a
stored program, decoding fails with a builtin signature mismatch rather than
silently calling the wrong function.

`crates/kernel/src/vm/builtins/ADDING-BUILTINS.md` is the short in-repo version of
this rule. Follow it.

## How a call reaches the function

1. The compiler resolves the name to a `BuiltinId` and emits a function-call
   opcode. An unknown name is a compile error, unless the caller asked for the
   permissive option that rewrites it into `call_function`.
2. The VM yields `DispatchBuiltin`.
3. Before calling anything native, the VM checks for an override: a verb named
   `bf_<name>` on `#0`. If it exists, and the caller is not `#0` itself, that verb
   is called instead. A per-transaction bit set caches the absence of each proxy
   so the lookup is paid once.
4. A `Bf` activation is pushed. It copies the calling verb's flags, so the `d`
   flag behaviour follows the caller.
5. The registry maps the id to a function pointer and calls it.
6. The result is turned into a return, an error, or a VM instruction.

An id with no registered implementation gets a no-op that raises `E_INVIND`
naming the function. That is what an entry declared in the table but never
implemented does at runtime.

## The calling convention

Every builtin has the same Rust shape: it takes a `BfCallState` and returns either
a `BfRet` or a `BfErr`.

`BfCallState` gives the builtin its name, its arguments, the whole `ExecState`,
and the feature config. It does **not** carry the world state, the session, or the
scheduler client. Those come from the task's thread-local context through
`with_current_transaction` and its mutable form.

| Return | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BfRet::Ret(v)` | Success with a value. Returning the none type is a debug assertion failure. |
| `BfRet::RetNil` | Success with no meaningful value. Becomes integer zero. |
| `BfRet::VmInstr(e)` | Hand an `ExecutionResult` back to the VM: dispatch a verb, suspend, fork, roll back. |

| Error | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BfErr::ErrValue(e)` | An error carrying a message. Prefer this; the message reaches the MOO programmer. |
| `BfErr::Code(c)` | A bare error code, when compatibility requires no message. |
| `BfErr::Raise(e)` | An error that should be raised rather than offered as a value. |
| `BfErr::Rollback` | Ask the task to roll back and retry. Never construct this by hand from a world state error; use the world-state error helper, which maps a rollback-retry to this and everything else to a MOO error. |

Argument arity is **not** checked by the compiler or by the dispatcher. Every
builtin checks `args.len()` itself and returns `E_ARGS`. The table's declared
minimum and maximum exist to answer `function_info()`, not to enforce anything.
Type errors are `E_TYPE`, bad values are `E_INVARG`, denied permission is `E_PERM`.

Use the boolean helper on `BfCallState` rather than constructing a boolean
directly. Whether truth values come back as booleans or as integers is a feature
flag, and cores depend on the old behaviour.

## Permission helpers

`BfCallState` exposes two different notions of identity, and choosing wrong is a
security bug.

| Call | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `task_permissions()` | Database authorisation. The current task authority with the flags cached at call setup. |
| `task_authority()` | Builtin-level wizard, programmer, and owner checks. The same principal, but with flags re-read from the transaction, so a change made earlier in the same task is seen. |
| `caller_perms()` | Only for the `caller_perms()` builtin. Never for authorisation. |

The `require_*` helpers on `BfCallState` wrap the common patterns: wizard only,
programmer only, owner or wizard, and each of those with a capability-grant
escape hatch. Prefer a helper over an open-coded flag test, because the helpers
also honour capability grants. See `permissions-and-security`.

## What a builtin may not do

- **It may not commit or roll back.** Only the task loop does that. A builtin that
  wants a commit returns a suspend instruction; a builtin that wants a rollback
  returns `BfErr::Rollback` or a rollback instruction.
- **It may not block.** It holds a thread-pool worker and an open transaction for
  as long as it runs. Waiting on the network or on a subprocess goes through
  `worker_request()`, which suspends the task instead. See `moor/services/workers`.
- **It may not suspend the thread itself.** Suspension is a VM instruction that
  the task loop acts on after it has committed.
- **It may not loop unboundedly without paying ticks.** Opcode ticks are counted
  by the interpreter, not inside native code. A builtin with an unbounded internal
  loop must charge the task through the tick budget helper, or it escapes the task
  limits entirely.
- **It may not assume it runs once.** A conflict retry re-runs the task from its
  last commit point, so a builtin with an external side effect can run twice.
- **It may not hold a reference across a suspension.** Only what is stored in the
  builtin frame survives.

## Builtins that call MOO code

Use a trampoline. Write a small integer, and optionally one value, into the
builtin's own frame, then return a `VmInstr` that dispatches the verb. The frame
stays underneath the new activation. When the verb returns, the VM re-enters the
same builtin, which takes the trampoline number back out and continues.

`create()`, `recycle()`, `move()`, and `eval()` all work this way. A builtin that
returns with no trampoline set is assumed finished, and its recorded return value
is unwound immediately. An unrecognised trampoline number is a panic, deliberately.

## Documentation is generated from the source

The doc comments on a `bf_*` function are the documentation. A procedural macro in
`crates/builtin-docs-macro` reads every `bf_*.rs` file at compile time, parses it,
and extracts doc comments **only from functions that a `register_bf_*` function
actually registers**. The result is the table that `function_help()` serves in
world.

The convention the tests enforce: the first doc line is a usage signature, of the
form "Usage:" followed by the return type, the name, and the argument types. Write
it that way, or `function_help()` gives a first line that is not a signature.

An unregistered function's doc comment is silently dropped. If `function_help()`
returns nothing for a builtin you documented, check the registration first.

The book pages under `book/src/the-moo-programming-language/built-in-functions/`
and the status table beside them are hand-written, not generated. They drift. The
generated table and `function_info()` are the authority for what exists.

## Adding a builtin

1. **Choose the group.** It must be the group whose `bf_*.rs` module will hold the
   implementation.
2. **Append the entry** in `crates/common/src/builtins.rs`, at the end of that
   group's block, before the padding call. Never insert into the middle, never
   reorder, never delete. Do not write reserved entries by hand.
3. **Implement** the function in the matching `crates/kernel/src/vm/builtins/bf_*.rs`.
   Check arity first, then types, then permissions, then do the work.
4. **Register** it in that module's `register_bf_*` function, indexed by the
   name-to-offset helper.
5. **Document** it with a doc comment whose first line is the usage signature.
6. **Test** it with a `.moot` file under `crates/kernel/testsuite/moot/`. A moot
   file is MOO input and expected output, which is the right level for a builtin's
   observable behaviour. Add Rust unit tests only for logic that MOO cannot reach.
7. **Check the group has room.** Each group is capped, and the padding helper
   asserts. If a group is nearly full, split it before adding.

Adding a builtin is a database-compatibility change in one direction only: an old
server cannot decode a program that calls a new builtin. Appending never breaks an
existing program.

## Invariants

1. **Ids never move.** Appending is safe; anything else invalidates stored
   programs and stored databases.
2. **A registered builtin has a doc comment with a usage line.** The generated
   help table is the only in-world documentation.
3. **A world state error passes through the world-state error helper.** A
   rollback-retry that is turned into an ordinary MOO error breaks the retry
   protocol and produces silent inconsistency.
4. **A builtin never returns the none type.** It is not a valid MOO value.
5. **Permission checks use the live authority, not the cached one**, wherever the
   task could have changed the flags it is testing.
6. **Reserved entries stay reserved.** They are what makes the group scheme work.

## Failure branches

| Symptom | Cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| "Stored program builtin signature mismatch" on load | The builtin table changed under a stored program | Revert the reorder. If the change is intended, the database must be re-imported. |
| `E_INVIND` naming a builtin, at runtime | The id is declared in the table but nothing registered an implementation | Add the registration. |
| Panic: "Unknown builtin: <name>" at startup | A registration names a builtin absent from the table | The table entry and the registration disagree. |
| `function_help()` returns nothing for a new builtin | The function is not registered, or the registration pattern is not the one the macro recognises | Register it with the name-to-offset helper in a `register_bf_*` function. |
| A builtin's error reaches MOO as a plain error where a retry was expected | A world state error was converted directly instead of through the helper | Route it through the helper. |
| Compile error: unknown builtin function | The MOO source calls a name not in the table | Either the name is wrong or the builtin has not been added. |
| A wizard-only builtin is reachable by a player | A `bf_<name>` verb on `#0` overrides it, or the check used cached flags | Check `#0` for the override verb first. |

## Where the code lives

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `crates/common/src/builtins.rs` | The id table, the group padding, the signature hash. |
| `crates/kernel/src/vm/builtins/mod.rs` | The registry, `BfCallState`, `BfRet`, `BfErr`, the permission helpers, per-builtin counters. |
| `crates/kernel/src/vm/builtins/bf_*.rs` | One module per group. Implementations and their registration functions. |
| `crates/kernel/src/vm/builtins/ADDING-BUILTINS.md` | The in-repo checklist. |
| `crates/kernel/src/vm/builtins/docs.rs` | One macro invocation; expands to the generated documentation table. |
| `crates/builtin-docs-macro/src/lib.rs` | The macro that reads the `bf_*.rs` sources. |
| `crates/kernel/src/vm/vm_call.rs` | Calling and re-entering a builtin, and the `#0` proxy check. |
| `crates/schema/src/convert_program.rs` | Where the stored-program signature is checked. |
| `crates/kernel/testsuite/moot/` | MOO-level tests. |
| `crates/var/src/json.rs` | `moor_var::json`, the MOO/JSON mapping behind `generate_json` and `parse_json`, shared with the telnet host's GMCP. SYM converts to a JSON string. |
