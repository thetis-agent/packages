# The mooR object store

This skill is written in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English.

The `moor-db` crate in `crates/db` holds the world: every object, property, verb
program, and permission bit. It is a small purpose-built database, not a wrapper on
someone else's. It gives each task a consistent view of the world, detects conflict
at commit, and writes the result to a key-value store on disk.

Read this page to choose a child. Do not act from this page alone.

## Which child to read

- `moor/storage-and-state/transactions` — why a commit
  conflicts, and what a retry re-runs.
- `moor/storage-and-state/world-state-model` — how
  objects, properties, verbs and inheritance are stored, and who checks
  permissions.
- `moor/storage-and-state/storage-engine` — what is in
  memory, what is on disk, what survives a crash, and what a snapshot,
  checkpoint or migration is.
- `moor/storage-and-state/object-lifecycle-and-gc`
  — how an object is created, recycled or collected, and whether it is safe
  to hold a reference across a transaction.

## Common to all four

**One crate, four layers.** Each layer has one job, and each hides the layer below.

| Layer | Path | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| Public handle | `crates/db/src/lib.rs` | `TxDB`, the `Database` trait, opening the database |
| API adapters | `crates/db/src/api` | `DbWorldState`, permission checks, the loader and GC adapters |
| Engine | `crates/db/src/engine` | `MoorDB`, the relation set, the transaction type, the commit pipeline |
| Transaction machinery | `crates/db/src/tx` | Per-relation transactions, indexes, conflict check, resolvers |
| Providers | `crates/db/src/provider` | Encoding to and from the on-disk key-value store |
| Caches | `crates/db/src/cache` | Verb, property and ancestry resolution caches |

**One word, one meaning.** These four skills use these terms as follows.

| Term | Meaning here |
|---|---|
| Relation | One typed key-to-value map, such as `object_parent`. The unit of storage and of conflict. |
| Domain, codomain | The key and the value of a relation. |
| Working set | The mutations one transaction made, per relation, held until commit. |
| Root snapshot | The published in-memory version of every relation index. Readers start from one. |
| Snapshot interface | A read-only on-disk view used for export. A different thing from the root snapshot. |
| Transaction abort | The database refused the commit. The caller must run again. |
| Task abort | The scheduler stopped a task. See `moor/execution/task-scheduler`. |

**Two calls, one word.** `checkpoint` on the scheduler writes an objdef export to a
directory. `TxDB::checkpoint` is a separate trait method and currently does nothing.
Neither one forces the world state to disk. `storage-engine` explains this.

**Everything is one process.** The database is opened by the daemon and lives in that
process. There is no database server, no network hop, and no second writer. A second
process that opens the same directory is a fault, not a feature.

## Knowledge barriers

Do not change this area before you understand these. The code does not teach them.

| You must understand | Learn it from |
|---|---|
| Multi-version concurrency: readers on a snapshot, writers checked at commit | `transactions`, first two sections |
| Snapshot isolation, and how it differs from serializable | `transactions`, and note that the book calls it both things |
| The MOO object model: one parent, properties defined once and overridden, verbs resolved by ancestry | `world-state-model`, and `book/src/the-database/objects-in-the-moo-database.md` |
| The difference between a transaction abort and a task abort | `transactions`, then `moor/execution/task-scheduler` |
| Who owns a permission decision | `world-state-model`, then `moor/execution/permissions-and-security` |
| Why an object number is never reused | `object-lifecycle-and-gc` |

## The rule that holds across all four

A task is a transaction. Where a task begins and ends decides what it sees, what a
retry repeats, and what survives failure. If a change moves a transaction boundary,
it changes the semantics of the whole server, not only the database. Treat any such
change as a design change and read `moor/execution/task-scheduler` first.

## Where the book is behind the code

The book in `book/src` is the project's manual and a good introduction. Two places
disagree with the code, and the code is correct.

| Book statement | The code |
|---|---|
| `book/src/the-system/performance-and-concurrency.md` says the database has "serializable isolation" | No read set is tracked. Only written keys are checked. This is snapshot isolation. `book/src/the-database/transactions.md` says so correctly. |
| `book/src/the-database/transactions.md` says a conflicting command "automatically retries from the beginning" | A retry restores the task's virtual machine from the last transaction boundary. Only a task that never crossed one starts again from the beginning. |
| `book/src/the-system/server-assumptions-about-the-database.md` says restarting "will always restore the system to the state it was in" | Nothing in the database crate requests an fsync for world state. A clean stop drains the writer; an unclean stop can lose recent commits. |
| The same chapter lists textdump as one of two checkpoint formats | A checkpoint always writes objdef. The export-format option is deprecated and ignored, and says so in its own help text. |
